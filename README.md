# Falcon-9-Simulation
A simulation of the launch and landing of one of SpaceX's vehicles. Development started January 2017.

## Aim
I started this project with the aim of simulating the [landing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANv5UfZsvZQ) of [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/)'s Falcon 9 launch vehicle. The company made history with this feat on the 22nd December 2015.
The project has evolved to include the entire flight as well as support for additional vehicles in the future.
