1. Long term, look into how the SpaceX API (https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API) can be used to build missions. We'd need some method of combing the json response for e.g. the latest mission and integrating all data possible into the simulation.

2. Use some of the cool functions in ChIrrTools once the simulation is running to draw things like springs, and trajectories
